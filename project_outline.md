# InfoMentor Home Assistant Integration - Project Outline

## Overview
A comprehensive Home Assistant integration for InfoMentor school communication platform, providing real-time access to school schedules, news, and timeline entries for Swedish families.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Authentication (`auth.py`)
- OAuth-based authentication with InfoMentor
- Session management and token refresh
- Multi-pupil account support

#### 2. API Client (`client.py`)
- RESTful API interface to InfoMentor endpoints
- **Timetable Endpoint**: `/timetable/timetable/gettimetablelist` for school lessons
- **Time Registration**: `/TimeRegistration/TimeRegistration/GetTimeRegistrations/` for preschool/fritids
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Pupil switching capabilities

#### 3. Data Models (`models.py`)
- **TimetableEntry**: School lessons and educational activities
- **TimeRegistrationEntry**: Preschool/fritids care registrations  
- **ScheduleDay**: Complete daily schedule combining both types
- **NewsItem**, **TimelineEntry**: Communication from school
- **PupilInfo**: Student information

#### 4. Home Assistant Integration
- **Coordinator**: Data update coordination (30-minute intervals)
- **Sensors**: Multiple sensor types per pupil
- **Config Flow**: User-friendly setup via UI

### Key Data Properties

#### Schedule Day Properties
- **`has_school`**: ANY scheduled activity (lessons OR care)
- **`has_timetable_entries`**: Only actual school lessons 
- **`has_preschool_or_fritids`**: Time registrations for care

This distinction is crucial for accurate child type detection.

### Child Type Detection Logic

#### Fixed Algorithm (v1.2)
1. **Primary Check**: Any timetable entries → **School child**
2. **Fallback Logic**:
   - "fritids" time registrations → **School child**
   - "förskola" time registrations → **Preschool child** 
   - No clear indicators → **Preschool child** (default)

#### Previous Issue (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Used `has_school` property which included time registrations
- **Result**: Preschool children incorrectly classified as school children
- **Solution**: Now uses `has_timetable_entries` for accurate detection

## API Endpoints

### Timetable (School Lessons)
- **Primary**: `GET /timetable/timetable/gettimetablelist`
- **Fallback**: `POST /timetable/timetable/gettimetablelist`  
- **Data**: Subject schedules, teachers, rooms, times

### Time Registration (Preschool/Fritids)
- **Primary**: `GET /TimeRegistration/TimeRegistration/GetTimeRegistrations/`
- **Alternative**: `GET /TimeRegistration/TimeRegistration/GetCalendarData/`
- **Data**: Care schedules, attendance, leave days

### Communication
- **News**: `GET /news/news/getpupilnews`
- **Timeline**: `GET /timeline/timeline/getpupiltimeline`

## Sensor Types

### Per-Pupil Sensors
1. **Schedule Sensors**
   - `sensor.{name}_schedule` - Complete upcoming schedule
   - `sensor.{name}_today_schedule` - Today's activities
   - `binary_sensor.{name}_has_school_today` - School lessons today
   - `binary_sensor.{name}_has_preschool_today` - Care activities today
   - `sensor.{name}_child_type` - School vs preschool classification

2. **Communication Sensors**
   - `sensor.{name}_news` - School news count and content
   - `sensor.{name}_timeline` - Timeline entries count and content

### System Sensors
- `sensor.infomentor_pupil_count` - Total children in account

## Recent Major Fixes

### School Selection Heuristic Upgrade (v1.5)
- **Issue**: Authentication frequently diverted to the first municipality IdP (for example Avesta) instead of the correct school, leading to repeated login failures
- **Fix**: Added weighted heuristics that reuse the cached IdP choice, boost InfoMentor-operated endpoints, and prefer options matching the user's e-mail domain while penalising unrelated entries
- **Impact**: Automatic school selection now locks onto the intended IdP, avoiding incorrect detours and reducing the need for manual retries

### Today Schedule Date Calculation Fix (v1.4) - 2025-10-20
- **Issue**: Today's schedule showing incorrect date (e.g., Saturday schedule on Monday)
- **Symptom**: "Tomorrow" schedule correct, but "Today" schedule stuck on old date
- **Root Cause**: 
  - `get_today_schedule()` returned a cached value (`pupil_data["today_schedule"]`) set during data fetch
  - When InfoMentor servers had issues for multiple days, stale cached value was preserved
  - `get_tomorrow_schedule()` always calculated date dynamically, so it worked correctly
- **Example Scenario**:
  - Saturday: Fresh data fetched, `today_schedule` cached as Saturday
  - Sunday-Monday: Server issues, stale cache preserved (including Saturday's `today_schedule`)
  - Monday: `get_today_schedule()` returned Saturday ❌, `get_tomorrow_schedule()` calculated Tuesday ✅
- **Fix**: Modified `get_today_schedule()` to calculate date dynamically like `get_tomorrow_schedule()`
  - Now searches schedule list for current date each time instead of using cached value
  - Ensures correct date even when schedule data is several days old
- **Impact**: Today's schedule always shows correct date, resilient to server outages

### Home Assistant Restart Resilience (v1.3)
- **Issue**: HA restarts were forcing immediate authentication attempts, causing "Authentication Expired" errors
- **Cause**: Integration attempted fresh data fetch on startup even when recent cached data was available
- **Additional Issue**: Cached data was loaded as dictionaries but sensors expected model objects with attributes
- **Server Reliability Issue**: InfoMentor servers sometimes authenticate successfully but fail to return pupil IDs
- **Fix**: 
  - Load cached data from storage immediately on restart if less than 72 hours old
  - Added deserialization function to convert cached dict data back to proper model objects (ScheduleDay, NewsItem, etc.)
  - Added serialization function to properly convert dataclass objects to JSON-compatible dicts when saving
  - Defer authentication checks to background tasks scheduled 30 seconds after startup
  - Periodic background auth verification every 12 hours (non-blocking)
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff when authentication succeeds but pupil IDs aren't retrieved (up to 5 attempts)
  - Falls back to cached pupil IDs when InfoMentor servers fail to return them
  - Manual retry service for when automatic retries aren't enough
  - Authentication failures no longer block integration startup or data availability
- **Impact**: Integration remains functional through HA restarts and temporary authentication issues
- **Behaviour**: Uses cached data immediately, verifies credentials in background without disrupting service, automatically retries when InfoMentor servers are unreliable

### Child Type Detection Fix (v1.2)
- **Issue**: Preschool children showing as school children in HA
- **Cause**: Incorrect use of `has_school` property for classification
- **Fix**: Added `has_timetable_entries` property and updated logic
- **Impact**: Accurate school vs preschool distinction

### Timetable Endpoint Migration
- **Issue**: Calendar endpoint mixed holidays/events with lessons
- **Change**: Switched to dedicated timetable endpoint
- **Benefit**: More reliable school lesson detection

### Property Clarification
- **`has_school`**: Kept for backward compatibility (any activity)
- **`has_timetable_entries`**: New property for precise lesson detection
- **Clear semantics**: Each property has a specific, documented purpose

### Schedule Fetching Optimisation (v0.0.31)
- **Issue**: Monday cache issues when schedule data wasn't available for the current day
- **Solution**: Modified date range calculation to always fetch through end of following week
- **Implementation**: Calculate days to next Sunday (13 - current_weekday) for consistent coverage
- **Benefit**: Prevents cache gaps and ensures complete week coverage regardless of fetch day
