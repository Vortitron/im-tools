# InfoMentor Integration Modernisation Project

## ✅ **COMPLETED - Production Ready!**

The InfoMentor integration has been successfully modernised from shell scripts to a comprehensive Python library with full Home Assistant integration.

### Working Endpoints (Verified)
- `https://hub.infomentor.se` - Main hub (redirects to login as expected)
- `https://infomentor.se/swedish/production/mentor/` - Legacy login endpoint
- `https://hub.infomentor.se/Communication/News/GetNewsList` - News API
- `https://hub.infomentor.se/grouptimeline/grouptimeline/appData` - Timeline API
- `https://hub.infomentor.se/GroupTimeline/GroupTimeline/GetGroupTimelineEntries` - Timeline entries

## ✅ **Completed Implementation**

### Phase 1: Python Library ✅
- ✅ `InfoMentorClient` - Full async API client with session management
- ✅ `InfoMentorAuth` - Complex 7-step authentication flow (OAuth, cookies, PIN handling)
- ✅ `Models` - Complete data models (NewsItem, TimelineEntry, PupilInfo, etc.)
- ✅ `Exceptions` - Proper exception hierarchy with specific error types
- ✅ Robust error handling and logging throughout
- ✅ Multi-pupil support with switching capability
- ✅ Browser-like headers and session management

### Phase 2: Home Assistant Integration ✅
- ✅ Custom component with proper manifest and dependencies
- ✅ Configuration flow with UI and credential validation
- ✅ Data update coordinator with proper error handling
- ✅ Sensor entities for news, timeline, and pupil count
- ✅ Device registry integration
- ✅ Service registration (refresh_data, switch_pupil)
- ✅ Translation strings for UI
- ✅ Service definitions with schemas
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Phase 3: Production Features ✅
- ✅ Proper async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Session management and cleanup
- ✅ Rich entity attributes with latest item details
- ✅ Automation examples and troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Privacy and security considerations
- ✅ Error handling for authentication and connection issues

## Installation & Usage

The integration is now ready for production use:

1. **Installation**: Copy to `custom_components/infomentor/` or install via HACS
2. **Configuration**: Add via Home Assistant UI with username/password
3. **Monitoring**: Automatic sensors for each pupil's news and timeline
4. **Automation**: Rich attributes enable sophisticated automations
5. **Services**: Manual refresh and pupil switching available

## Migration from Shell Scripts

The original shell script functionality has been completely preserved and enhanced:

- ✅ `imlogin.sh` → `InfoMentorAuth.login()`
- ✅ `imnews.sh` → `InfoMentorClient.get_news()`
- ✅ `imtimeline.sh` → `InfoMentorClient.get_timeline()`
- ✅ `imswitchpupil.sh` → `InfoMentorClient.switch_pupil()`
- ✅ `imlogout.sh` → Automatic session cleanup

## Benefits of Modernisation

1. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and recovery
2. **Maintainability**: Clean, typed Python code
3. **Integration**: Native Home Assistant compatibility
4. **Automation**: Rich data for sophisticated automations
5. **Security**: Secure credential storage and session management
6. **Usability**: UI configuration and comprehensive documentation

## Status: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

The InfoMentor integration is now a fully-featured, production-ready Home Assistant integration that successfully modernises the original shell script functionality while adding significant enhancements for reliability, usability, and integration capabilities.
