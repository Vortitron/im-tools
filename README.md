# EasyIM - An alternative Infomentor tool 

# What?
A bash script tool suite that interfaces with the infomentor system api.

# Why?
The primary objective is to enable and make available a frictionless experience when accessing your kid's news feed.
The secondary objective is to make available an alternative, simple but first and foremost, easy-to-use alternative user interface to the infomentor api - contrary to what the official infomentor app displays in terms of usability.

# How?
This tool suite lets you perform login, logout, pupil switching and news feed fetching.
